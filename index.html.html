        <h1>Rose is BATWOMAN!?!?!?</h1>
        Usually, the relationship between the main character and his identity as a costumed hero is unambiguous.<br/>
        The hero wears a mask that only serves to hide her true personality from her enemies and the crowd in order to protect her privacy and that of her loved ones.<br/>

        Why she's Batwoman???<br/>
	Because she's bald and she has wig red hair!<br/>
	She is 25 years old and her strength lies in her detective skills, intelligence,physical abilities and access to cutting-edge technology.<br/>
        Its training, its resources, its rigour thus largely compensate for the absence of a specific power.<br/>
	She is a master in many martial disciplines (especially with her bare hands) who has varied in time. In the early days, Batwoman practiced judo and jiujitsu then karate and kung fu.<br/>
